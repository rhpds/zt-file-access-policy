lab:
  name: "File Access Policy"
  shortname: "zt-file-access-policy"
  maintainer: "Nate Lager (nlager@redhat.com)" 
  
  description:
    summary: "Learn how to configure and use file access policy in Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
    goal: "After completing this scenario, users will be able to deploy and manage application control on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems."
    concepts:
     - "Install File Access Policy Daemon (fapolicyd)"
     - "Verify fapolicyd configuration and block unauthorized applications"
     - "Create a file-based trust database to allow trusted applications"
     - "Configure integrity checking for fapolicyd"
    use_case: "In this lab, you are going to configure application control for Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems. Application control is a security approach designed to protect against unauthorized process execution on systems. When implemented correctly, application control helps mitigate the risk of malicious code (malware), such as ransomware, executing on a system."

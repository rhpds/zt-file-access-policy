Now that we’ve seen how the daemon is configured, let’s see it in
action.

Let’s install a new application from an internet source, `+cowsay+`.
There is nothing inherently malicious about this binary, though it
provides a good example for our application control workflow.
Extract `+cowsay+` into the user’s home directory.

[source,bash,run]
----
tar xsf cowsay_2.0.4_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
----

You should have no problems executing the `+cowsay+` binary:

[source,bash,run]
----
./cowsay "mooooo"
----

Let’s start up fapolicyd and see what happens:

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo systemctl start fapolicyd
----

Now run the `+cowsay+` command again.

[source,bash,run]
----
./cowsay "mooooo"
----

You’ll obtain the following error.

[source,text]
----
-bash: ./cowsay: Operation not permitted
----

Great! Because the `+cowsay+` binary isn’t in the RPM database, or the
file-backed trust database configured at
`+/etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.trust+`, the execution is blocked.

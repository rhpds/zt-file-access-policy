Let’s take a quick look at fapolicyd and integrity. The `+more+` command
is installed via the RPM database, so it’s trusted to execute on the
system:

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo rpm -qf /bin/more
----

What if the more command was substituted out for something malicious?
First, let’s verify that fapolicyd is still running:

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo systemctl status fapolicyd
----

Now let’s substitute the `+more+` command for the `+cowsay+` binary in
our user’s home directory:

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo /bin/cp ./cowsay /bin/more
----

[source,bash,run]
----
/bin/more "mooooo"
----

Hmmmm. So by default, fapolicyd doesn’t check what the file looks like,
only where it is executing from. This means that an attacker could
potentially hijack the execution path of a trusted file, and execute
malicious code on behalf of a user.
